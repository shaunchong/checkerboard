# checkerboard
Draws a checkerboard using python

I decided to pick up the basics of python one day and decided to implement a 
simple question - given a function drawSquare(x, y, colour), draw out a 
checkerboard.

At the same time I was learning what functional programming was all about,
so I decided to write a solution in both ways, one using OOP and the other
using FP.
